Implementing the concept of green development and accelerating the construction of ecological civilization

Under the guidance of the concept of green development, our party has integrated the construction of ecological civilization into the "five in one" concept, vigorously brought into play the institutional advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics, led the people of all ethnic groups to build a beautiful China with one heart and one mind, and walked out a new road of ecological civilization construction.

First, we should give full play to the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, our party has been actively exploring the regularity of ecological civilization construction, giving full play to the role of public economy in ecological civilization construction, striving to create conditions for non-public economy to play a positive role in ecological civilization construction, and promoting various economic forms to combine the pursuit of their own interests with the social interests of ecological civilization construction Give full play to the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and thoroughly implement the concept of green development.

Second, we should attach great importance to and strengthen the construction of ideas and promote ecological ethics. In real life, with the improvement of material living standards, some people pursue material enjoyment excessively, live extravagantly and spend money like dirt; some enterprises blindly pursue economic benefits and destroy the environment wantonly; some local governments ignore the environment and pursue economic growth unilaterally, etc. all these are the manifestations of low ecological moral level. It is difficult to achieve the goal of protecting the ecological environment when the social ecological moral level is not up to the standard. Therefore, we should vigorously strengthen the construction of ecological ethics, strengthen the education of ecological concept among all members of society, arouse people's consciousness of environmental protection, and make environmental protection a conscious behavior and habit of the whole people.

Third, we should formulate and implement the development strategy of ecological civilization. In order to effectively implement the construction of ecological civilization, governments at all levels should pay attention to ecological construction according to the idea of system engineering, firmly establish the concept of ecological red line, optimize the pattern of land and space development, comprehensively promote resource conservation, and strengthen the protection of ecological environment. In the process of promoting the supply side structural reform, we should integrate environmental protection with the optimization of industrial structure, effectively change the unreasonable industrial structure, energy structure and resource utilization, vigorously promote green development, circular development and low-carbon development, and make the economy develop in the direction of higher quality, more efficiency, more fairness and more sustainable.

Fourth, we need to change our ideas and strengthen the construction of institutional civilization. Strengthening the construction of ecological civilization is inseparable from the renewal of ideas. General secretary Xi Jinping pointed out clearly that leading cadres at all levels must firmly believe in protecting the ecological environment, resolutely abandon the development models and practices of damage and even destroy the ecological environment, and must never sacrifice the ecological environment at the expense of economic growth at any time. Therefore, we should establish the concept of protecting the ecological environment, promote the construction of institutional civilization, require governments at all levels to take the responsibility of providing and maintaining the most fair public product of good ecological environment, constantly strengthen the institutional supply function that helps to protect the ecological environment, implement the most powerful institutional constraints, and truly change from economic growth to environmental protection We should pay equal attention to economic development and environmental protection, change from environmental protection lagging behind economic development to synchronous development of environmental protection and economy, and change from mainly using administrative methods to comprehensively using law, economy, technology and necessary administrative means to protect the environment.
